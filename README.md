# Keep Fit
The keep fit app was created for the Mobile Software and Applications course work. The app was developed for Android 11 and takes advantage of many of androids Jetpack libraries including:

 - Hilt
 - Room
 - Fragment
 - Lifecycle
 - Recyclerview
 - Material Design Components
 - Datastore 
 - Navigation

The appliocation was developed using Kotlin as this is now the recommended way in which to build android apps using the android sdk. The app developed also attempts to follow the mvvm architecture.

## Aims and rationale
> The aim of this exercise is to gain some experience in developing
> mobile applications by building an app that allows users to set
> fitness goals and to record physical activity towards the completion
> of their goal. Although there are a number of such apps currently
> available offering a variety of features including automatic detection
> of user activities, in this exercise the focus is a much simpler app.
> More specifically, the app is limited to walking and focused mostly on
> the manual recording of user activities

## Required functionality
 1. Goal activity recording
 2. Multiple goal setting
 3. Activity history
 4. Historical activity recording
 5. User preferences and settings
 
 ### Extra functionality
 6. User notifications
 7. Step counter integration

##  Summery
Overall the application was received well when demonstrated, all required features had been added. An attempt was made to implement an automatic step counter. The step counter would benefit from being implemented into job scheduler allowing it to run in the background
